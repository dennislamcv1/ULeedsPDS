## Programming for Data Science

Explore the basics of programming and familiarise yourself with the Python language. After completing this course, you will be able to write Python programs in Jupyter Notebook and describe basic programming.

In this course, you will learn everything you need to start your programming journey. You will discover the different data types available in Python and how to use them, learn how to apply conditional and looping control structures, and write your own functions.  

This course provides detailed descriptions of new concepts and background information for additional context. The quizzes available will help you to develop your understanding. You will also complete exercises using Jupyter Notebook on your computer. By using Jupyter Notebook, you will be able to combine your notes with useful examples so that you develop the resources you need to program independently in the future.
